This is my repo for all the bash scripting codes that I will be doing.

### INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO EXECUTE THE PROGRAMS
* Clone this repositry to your local machine.
* Now, open your terminal(in the same directory you cloned this repository).
* Now, type _chmod 755 file name && ./file name_ this will execute that particular file.
* If you wish to see the code then open it up in your preferred text editor.
###### Note that you need to chmod only the first time you execute that particular file
